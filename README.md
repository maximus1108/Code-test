# The challenge
We want to see how you would approach building a simple web application that is capable of searching a list of Dare West employees by name and displaying the results. The requirements are as follows:
* As an end user, I can search Dare West employees by name via a simple form and see a list of results.
* Each result will display a user's avatar, name and job role.
* I will be able to view and interact with the UI regardless of the viewport size of the device I am using.

Please focus on writing well-documented code that efficiently solves this problem. We would rather you submitted a subset of features with reasoning for your work than a rushed, comprised version of the entire app.

## Setup
Clone this repo and the rest is up to you! Weâ€™re not gonna tell you what stack to choose, weâ€™re interested to see how you work. Pick the tools you feel are most appropriate for the job and get coding ðŸ’ƒ.

## Assets
You can find mobile and desktop layouts for this application on [invision](https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/9K38E7GH5DTYG/). Any other assets can be provided on request. Please use the Google Font [Arvo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arvo).

## API
Your shiny new app wonâ€™t be very happy without any data so weâ€™ve built a simple API to help. `http://darewestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/staff/search` will return a json object of our friendly staff. This endpoint will accept a `name` search parameter.
